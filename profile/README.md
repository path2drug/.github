# Path2Drug

## About Path2Drug

Path2Drug aims to accelerate therapeutic discovery and translational research by bridging omics analysis with actionable drug candidates. The project develops integrative workflows to transform enrichment results—whether from gene expression, pathway analysis, or large-scale screening—into prioritized drug lists and mechanistic insights, empowering researchers with comprehensive translational intelligence for preclinical and clinical applications.

## Goals

- **Generalized Drug Discovery Pipelines**  
  Build modular, extensible workflows capable of ingesting diverse enrichment outputs (such as GSEA, RNA-Seq, and Connectivity Map) to generate curated drug candidates and mechanistic targets.
  
- **Comprehensive Target Annotation**  
  Enrich targets with advanced biological information, classification, and therapeutic relevance using multi-modal data sources and annotation platforms (e.g., UniProt, OpenTarget).

- **Clinical Intelligence Integration**  
  Incorporate clinical evidence, safety profiles, and literature validation to ensure translational relevance and guide experimental prioritization.

- **Automated Data-Driven Analysis**  
  Leverage both rule-based and AI-powered approaches for surface marker identification, target prioritization, and drug repurposing predictions.

- **Community Resources**  
  Deliver open datasets, reusable code modules, interactive web applications, and transparent documentation for the scientific community.
